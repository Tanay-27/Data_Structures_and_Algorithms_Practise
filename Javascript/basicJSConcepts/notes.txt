Arrays Memory Allocation.
when an array is declared, it allocates a certain memory block which is contiguous.
When this limit exceeds, a new memory block with generally double the size is allocated at a different location, the data is copied and present memory is deallocated.
Since this is an expensive operation. We can preallocate memory if we know from start;
let arr = new Array(size); (default value is undefined for all elements, tested)



Stacks
For stacks one can simply use arrays in javascript, since it provides constant time operations for pushing and poping.
But if the size of array needs to be huge. a linked list approach might provide better performance since linked list provides constant time complexity for adding/removing elements from its head.
